Hello! I am Lorenzo, and I hope to eventually learn coding, as well as game design! I come from Long Beach, California, and I am 17 years old. I see failure as an opportunity for growth, and I always try to go above and beyond with my projects. I am excited to be a part of the KKCF and to see what the fture has in store!

Thank you for reading!

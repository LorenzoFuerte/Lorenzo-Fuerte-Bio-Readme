Hello! I am Lorenzo, and I hope to eventually learn coding, as well as game design! I come from Long Beach, California, and I am 17 years old. I see failure as an opportunity for growth, and I always try to go above and beyond with my projects. I am excited to be a part of the KKCF and to see what the future has in store!

I am excited to learn Github, as it seems to be an essential resoruce for developers of all kinds. I hope to see what this platform is capable of, as well as learning how to use it to its fullest!

Thank you for reading!
